Deficiencies can cause tip chlorosis or necrosis or cause foliage to discolor, fade, distort, or become spotted, sometimes in a characteristic pattern that can be recognized to identify the cause. Fewer leaves, flowers, and fruit may be produced, and these can develop later than normal and remain undersized. More severely deficient plants become stunted and exhibit dieback. Nutrient deficiencies rarely occur in most woody landscape plants. When they do occur, nitrogen and iron are the most commonly seen deficiencies. However, nutrient deficiency symptoms usually are not due to a deficiency in the soil but are caused by conditions that reduce a plant's access to them. Poor root growth caused by water-logged soil, root diseases, and nematodes can cause deficiency symptoms. Commercial laboratories can conduct foliage tests or soil analysis to verify deficiencies."

They can also be espaliered. They can grow up to 6 feet tall. \n Gardenias are best grown in rich organic soils with acidic pH. They require well-drained soil. Avoid crowding with other plants and use surface cultivation. Plants do best in partial shade in hot inland valleys. Avoid high salt conditions. Mulches may help conserve water and decrease soil temperature fluctuations."
